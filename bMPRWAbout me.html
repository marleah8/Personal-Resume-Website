<!-- This part is to get images and quick descriptions onto the 'about me' page-->
<!-- It took me SO long to get the images to work properly so I'm very proud, and I also tested out my newfound talent, hence the amount of photos-->

              <center><h1> About Me </h1></center> 
              <p>My name is Marleah! I am a senior at the Bay School of San Francisco. In the future, I'll be studying international Relations or Political Science, though I have an interest in Neuroscience as well. 
                <center><p> ~~~ </p></center>
                At home, I speak German with my mother, and, less successfully, with my dog, Louis. My Hobbies include building things/woodworking, making such as jewlery, reading (my favourite books at the moment are 'Septology' by John Fosse and 'The North Woods' by Daniel Mason). I also LOVE to explore-- whether through travelling, hiking, or just wandering around new places, I always find joy in discovering new things. 
            Currently, my favourite classes include Comparative Philosophy, Computer Science, and Gothic Literature. </p> 
            <center><p> Here are some photos of the things I've made!</p>

            <p> Here are some photos of a shelf I made-- out of old vinyls!</p>
