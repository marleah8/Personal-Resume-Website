        <h3> Patricular Qualifications: </h3>   
        <ul> 
    <h4><li> I speak German fluently, and have tested to the DSD2. (The highest level of rigor for a German university level language entrance exam)</li>
    <li> I have a genuine curiosity and passion for many things, and strive to emphasize the interconnections between such interests; from Mathematics to philosophy, or physical activity to biology, I love to examine the web of our tangled and connected world.</li>
    <li> When I have an interest in something, nothing can get in my way; I will continue to strive in learing, gaining information, and doing what I want to get done. For example, I am currently trying to learn Latin, as I want to gain a deeper understanding of the foundations of our language, both spoken and in literature.</li></h4>
